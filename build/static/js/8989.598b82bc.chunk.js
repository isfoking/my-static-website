Gambling while under the age of 18 is a criminal offence, and we take our responsibilities to prevent access for those under the age of 18 very seriously. HEY777 reserves the right to request proof of age documentation from any user at any time and any winnings will be confiscated if on completion of age verification the customer is shown to be underage.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: \u5fae\u8f6f\u96c5\u9ed1;">b. At HEY777, we encourage our users to enjoy gambling in a responsible manner. However, we do recognise that gambling can become addictive and may lead to problem gambling or even addiction for some people. In order to ensure users play responsibly, we offer a range of tools that can be used to control play, such as different types of limits or short breaks. For more information, please see our Responsible Gaming page.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: \u5fae\u8f6f\u96c5\u9ed1;">c. In order to set or manage the Responsible Gaming limits, you must log in to your Account.
